# mc-skin-texture-lookup
Get a Minecraft Skin Texture by entering a username.

## Get the tool
If you want to use the tool you can clone the repo and use either one of the executables
in the release/ folder. The libraries are linked statically so you can just take the
executable and put it wherever you want.

## Compile the tool
If you want to compile this yourself, the only dependency is Qt, so you
can use qmake with the .pro file.
